# Cloud Amazon Alexa Skill

An Amazon Alexa Smarthome Skill that uses the Cloud Connection Broker of this repository
to communicate with a connected Cloud-Connector-Addon directly.

This skill is basically a pass-through connecting the Alexa Cloud (where the voice recognition happens)
with the Cloud Connection Broker.
