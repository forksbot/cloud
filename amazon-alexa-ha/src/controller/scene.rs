//! The Alexa.SceneController interface describes messages for activating and optionally deactivating multiple devices that are grouped together into a scene.
//! Activation support is required, but you describe whether a scene can be deactivated during device discovery.
//!
//! Not implemented. This interface is broken by design in V3.
//! * There is no i18n support for scene names.
//! * Scenes cannot be proactively updated after a discovery.
